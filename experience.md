##### Workday
*Software Development Engineer II*<br />
February 2016 - June 2017<br />
San Francisco, CA

Most of my work revolved around shipping search features in a search microservice and scaling/monitoring multiple Elasticsearch clusters across multiple datacenters. Some of the features shipped include search relevance, faceting, and filtering for reporting products using Elasticsearch. On the infrastructure side of things, I helped scale out our clusters to handle terabyte storage and hundreds of queries per second growth, instrumented our service with metrics to improve search latency response times to <1s, and wrote scripts to monitor and alert on search infrastructure availability. I also participated in the on-call engineer rotation, triaging criticality and solving time-sensitive issues.

In addition, I acted as Scrum Master for the team with focus on velocity management and collaboration growth through reflection and iteration.

*Lab Assistant*<br />

My desire to mentor and help those starting on their journey down UC Berkeley's CS program brought me to this position. As a Lab Assistant, I assisted Teaching Assistants (TA) in lab and office hours by answering any questions students may have about **Python**, the class, or programming in general. In addition, I dedicated at least 3 hours a week to ensuring students understand the material and provide tutoring when needed.

##### Circle K International, California-Nevada-Hawaii (CNH) District
*District Technology Chair*<br />
April 2013 - March 2014<br />
Rancho Cucamonga, CA

Part of my extracurriculars included being active with community service through Circle K. During my time in Circle K, I served as District Technology Chair for the CNH District. During my tenure, I revamped and maintained the [district website](www.cnhcirclek.org) and the resource database, assisted over 60 clubs in the areas of technology and publicity, and led a Public Relations Committee of 10 members from all over California, Nevada, and Hawaii to publicize district events and provide resources to clubs. The District Board consisted of 20 other members, aimed at achieving our goals of improving our district through its three tenets of service, leadership, and fellowship.
