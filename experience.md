My desire to mentor and help those starting on their journey down UC Berkeley's CS program brought me to this position. As a Lab Assistant, I assisted Teaching Assistants (TA) in lab and office hours by answering any questions students may have about **Python**, the class, or programming in general. In addition, I dedicated at least 3 hours a week to ensuring students understand the material and provide tutoring when needed.

*District Technology Chair*<br />
April 2013 - March 2014<br />
Rancho Cucamonga, CA

Part of my extracurriculars included being active with community service through Circle K. During my time in Circle K, I served as District Technology Chair for the CNH District. During my tenure, I revamped and maintained the [district website](www.cnhcirclek.org) and the resource database, assisted over 60 clubs in the areas of technology and publicity, and led a Public Relations Committee of 10 members from all over California, Nevada, and Hawaii to publicize district events and provide resources to clubs. The District Board consisted of 20 other members, aimed at achieving our goals of improving our district through its three tenets of service, leadership, and fellowship.
