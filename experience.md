##### UC Berkeley, CS 61A (Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs)
*Lab Assistant*<br />
Fall 2014, Spring 2015<br />
Berkeley, CA

My desire to mentor and help those starting on their journey down UC Berkeley's CS program brought me to this position. As a Lab Assistant, I assisted Teaching Assistants (TA) in lab and office hours by answering any questions students may have about **Python**, the class, or programming in general. In addition, I dedicated at least 3 hours a week to ensuring students understand the material and provide tutoring when needed.

UC Berkeley's CS 61A is the largest class that Berkeley offers and is the introductory course for CS and EECS majors, providing a foundation in programming, not about how to use one particular programming language. It concentrates mostly on the idea of abstraction, allowing the programmer to think in terms appropriate to the problem rather than in low-level operations dictated by the computer hardware.

The District Board consisted of 20 other members, aimed at achieving our goals of improving our district through its three tenets of service, leadership, and fellowship.

January 2013 - May 2013<br />
