##### Workday
*Software Development Engineer*<br />
February 2016 - June 2017<br />
San Francisco, CA

Team: Search. Responsible for delivering search relevance for different applications within Workday. For Search, I built and shipped relevance search for reports in Workday, empowering reports to be more intelligent and useful. I also wrote scripts to deploy, maintain, and monitor our microservice and platform. I served as a Scrum Master for Search, helping our team improve week after week through constant reflection and iteration. The team's endeavor at the time was replacing the current search implementation with a more scalable and fault tolerant search microservice and Elasticsearch platform. Ownership spanned the entire search stack from development, to deployment and monitoring.

Tech Stack: **Scala, Java, Ruby, and Elasticsearch**. *Level 2*.

My desire to mentor and help those starting on their journey down UC Berkeley's CS program brought me to this position.

Part of my extracurriculars included being active with community service through Circle K. During my time in Circle K, I served as District Technology Chair for the CNH District. During my tenure, I revamped and maintained the [district website](www.cnhcirclek.org) and the resource database, assisted over 60 clubs in the areas of technology and publicity, and led a Public Relations Committee of 10 members from all over California, Nevada, and Hawaii to publicize district events and provide resources to clubs.
