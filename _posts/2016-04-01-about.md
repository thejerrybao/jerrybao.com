Hi, I'm **Jerry Bao**, an aviation enthusiast that loves hacking away at engineering challenges. I graduated from the University of California, Berkeley with a Bachelor of Arts degree in Computer Science about a year ago. I'm an avid learner and self-starter; I like to work on projects that interest me in my spare time, which you can find in the [Projects](../projects) section. In addition, [you can take a look at my resume](https://www.dropbox.com/s/sn728i6k2qvzzq2/JerryBao-Resume.pdf?dl=0), [scrutinize my work on GitHub](https://www.github.com/thejerrybao), [or connect with me through LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/thejerrybao). Currently, I work for [Workday](https://www.workday.com) in San Francisco, CA on the SYMAN Search Team, helping deliver a new search platform built on Elasticsearch.

One thing I love to do is connect with people and learn from passionate and talented individuals about the incredible projects they're working on. I'm always interested in chatting, whether it may be about an opportunity, the software industry, or life/career topics. Feel free to reach out to me; I look forward to hearing from or connecting with you!
