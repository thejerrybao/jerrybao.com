Hi, I'm **Jerry Bao**, a recent graduate from University of California, Berkeley with a degree in Computer Science. I'm an avid learner and self-starter; I like to work on projects that interest me in my spare time, which you can find in the [Projects](../projects) section. In addition, [you can take a look at my resume](https://www.dropbox.com/s/sn728i6k2qvzzq2/JerryBao-Resume.pdf?dl=0), [scrutinize my work on GitHub](https://www.github.com/thejerrybao), [or connect with me through LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/thejerrybao). I look forward to hearing from or connecting with you!

This website is still under construction and will probably go through a lot of change in the coming months.
