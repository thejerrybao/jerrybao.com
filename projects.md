These are some of my own personal endeavors and ideas I had that I wanted to try and build myself. On occasions, I spend my free time working on unfinished projects.

##### House of Cards: Multiplayer Deck [[repo](https://github.com/thejerrybao/houseofcards)]
*Ruby on Rails*

Created an API that allowed users to play with any number of decks together. In progress.

##### Black Cleaver: Bill Splitter [[repo](https://github.com/thejerrybao/blackcleaver)]
*Python (Django), Venmo API*

Built an app that easily allows parties to split restaurant bills, enabling one person to mass charge users with Venmo using the Venmo API. Currently being reworked.

##### Caravan Party: Caravan Tracking App [[repo](https://github.com/thejerrybao/CaravanParty)]
*Ruby on Rails, Android, Google Maps API*

Designed an application for Android that tracks multiple cars going to the same destination and relays their location in real-time to all caravans. Cars were routed toward the destination set by the host caravan using the Google Maps API. Included a basic friend system so that users can invite friends to their caravans.

##### Nimbus: Club Management System [[repo](https://github.com/thejerrybao/Nimbus)]
*PHP, JavaScript, SQL*

Wrote over 5000 lines of code to create a system that manages a Circle K club's day-to-day operations. Enables Circle K clubs to manage their events, members, committees, blog posts, and statistics. Currently the system is used by UC Berkeley Circle K, whose website can be found [here](www.ucbcki.org).
