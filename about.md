Hi, I'm **Jerry Bao**, a senior engineer experienced with data, search, infrastructure, distributed systems, and a tiny bit of machine learning. I have a proven record of managing and delivering complex and multi-stakeholder projects. I'm also an aviation enthusiast (with a private pilot certificate) that loves traveling and eating my way through the world. I graduated from the **University of California, Berkeley** with a **Bachelor of Arts** degree in **Computer Science** in **2015**. Connect with me through [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/thejerrybao) or or take a look at my [resume](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0Bx0czQqw9NLfQkVqRFdKWUhvUEU)!
