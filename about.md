Hi, I'm **Jerry Bao**, an aviation enthusiast (with a private pilot certificate) that loves hacking away at engineering challenges. I graduated from the **University of California, Berkeley** with a **Bachelor of Arts** degree in **Computer Science** in **2015**. I'm an avid learner and self-starter; I like to work on projects that interest me in my spare time, which you can find in the [Projects](../projects) section. In addition, [you can take a gander at my resume](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0Bx0czQqw9NLfQkVqRFdKWUhvUEU), [connect with me through LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/thejerrybao), [or see what I've worked on in my spare time on GitHub](https://www.github.com/thejerrybao). Currently, I work for [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com) in San Francisco, CA on Search.
